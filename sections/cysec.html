    <h2>//About</h2>
    <p>The Cyber Security Division is focused on collective learning and skill development in the field of cybersecurity. Our goal is to create an environment where individuals can explore, solve problems, and enhance their knowledge together. We focus on practical, hands-on learning, using real-world challenges to build proficiency in key cybersecurity concepts and tools.</p>
    <p>Through guided exercises and collaborative problem-solving, members are encouraged to engage with various cybersecurity platforms, such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox, to further their understanding. This division is built around the idea that growth comes from continuous exploration and mutual support, enabling individuals to advance at their own pace while contributing to the learning of others.</p>
